sentence=Arduino library that provides a non-blocking repeating timer with callback functionality.
paragraph=This library is designed to simplfy using the builtin Arduino mills function without all the setup. This is done by creating a MyDealy object and setting the amount of time for the delay you want. From there you place code you want to run in a if statement that checks the update(). If the time for the delay has passed, update will return true. You are also able to run a function in place of an if statement block using a void function and adding it when creating the MyDealy object.  You can also set a maximum number of times the timer will repeat.  The default is to repeat forever.
