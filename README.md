#MyDelay Library #

This library is designed to simplfy using the builtin Arduino mills function without all the setup.

## About this Library ##

To start create a MyDelay variable. From here you are able to set a delay time, a delay time, a
function to run and a repeat count or nothing at all.

To check it if the delay time has past, call the update function which will check time and 
run the set function.

Using the start function, you are able to restart the timer for delay. This allows you more
control over then a delay with trigger.


The delay time can be change using setDelay using a time in miliseconds. 

The use of the fupdate function is not Deprecated and will be removed in the future.
